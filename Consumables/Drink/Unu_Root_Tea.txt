Unu root is famously delicious, and gets better the longer it is stewed. Drinking the tea is typically accompanied by a brief headrush and a feeling of peace. Unu root tea is dressed in many ways. Connoisseurs typically consider it sacrilige to add anything, but most people drink it with a bit of sugar and milk. Soldiers are famous for turning their tea into something approaching candy by adding copious amounts of sugar and milk when they are available.
